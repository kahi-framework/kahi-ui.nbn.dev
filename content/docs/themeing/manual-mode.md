# Manual Mode

By default, Kahi UI switches between dark and light mode depending on the user's preferences. As reported by the Browser / OS. However to provide a theme toggle or if you want to disable this behavior. You can use the `data-mode="dark/light"` attribute on the `<html>` element.

```svelte
<html data-mode="dark">
    <head>
        ...
    </head>
</html>
```
