# v0.6.0 Alpha 1

Hi and thanks for waiting for the `v0.6.0` release! I know feature updates has stalled completely for a while due to the major rearchitecture going on. But it's allowed me to include two major features that I'm sure most people will love! You know what "they" say, something something lessons learned the hard way...

## Custom Builds

> For more information, see the [Custom Builds documentation](/docs/framework/custom-builds).

It's been a long time since the very first public `v0.2.0` release, and A LOT of features have been added in. Which with modern toolchains like Vite, JS can be easily tree shaken! What can't be tree shaken however, is the CSS distributables. As of this first `v0.6.X` release, the Framework CSS distributable are a whopping `431+ KiB` (MIN: `367+ kB`) (MIN-BROTLI: `19+ KiB`) (MIN-GZIP: `32+ KiB`). Which is _A LOT_ for a CSS framework. Even with the minified version being compressed for transfer.

So one of the big features in this update is being able to download the source code of any given post-`v0.6.0` release and disabling specific CSS features in custom builds. Using the `npm run build:framework`, we can disable one of the main sources of bloat, global utility responitivitiy. e.g. `<* margin={["mobile:small"]}>`

```bash
npm run build:framework -- --disable-globals-intrinsics-responsitivity
```

Which takes the Framework CSS distributable from `431+ KiB` to `240+ KiB` (MIN: `206+ kB`) (MIN-BROTLI: `14+ KiB`) (MIN-GZIP: `19+ KiB`). That's about a `55%` reduction alone!

So with this feature you can highly tune your bundle size by excluding features you don't need. This does come with the draw back of needing to manually rebuild (or in a CI) the CSS each time you update Kahi UI. In the far future I do want to take a look at having a Vite plugin that can on-demand rebuild the SASS codebase. And also whenever `dart-sass` is compatible, integrate a builder UI into the documentation site.

## Custom Themes

> For more information, see the [Custom Themes documentation](/docs/themeing/custom-themes).

Previously the only documented way of customizing the theme of Kahi UI was using the per-Component CSS Custom Properties that were available and documented. However the overall global theme was not documented or easily customizable. Now with Custom Builds (see above), you can easily create your own themes.

Want to add a new palette color that instantly works? Open and edit the `src/themes/default/_theme.scss` file. Simply use the palette generator and define a new constant.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```scss
@include constants.define(
  (
    "palettes": (
      "<PALETTE>": generators.palette(
          $dark: (
            // Base darkmode color used to generate shades, can be in any color
            "base": <COLOR>,
            // How much of the `dark` palette should be mixed into the base color per shade
            "stepping": <PERCENTAGE>,
          ),
          $light: (
            // Base lightmode color used to generate shades, can be in any color
            "base": <COLOR>,
            // How much of the `light` palette should be mixed into the base color per shade
            "stepping": <PERCENTAGE>,
          )
        ),
    ),
  )
);
```

e.g.

```scss
@include constants.define(
    (
        "palettes": (
            "brand": generators.palette(
                    $dark: (
                        "base": hsl(200, 25%, 47.5%),
                        "stepping": 4%,
                    ),
                    $light: (
                        "base": hsl(200, 30%, 47.5%),
                        "stepping": 4%,
                    )
                ),
        ),
    )
);
```

Alternatively, you can manually specify shades.

```scss
@include constants.define(
    (
        "palettes": (
            "brand": (
                "dark": (
                    "base": hsl(200deg, 25%, 47.5%),
                    "foreground": "light",
                    "lightest": hsl(201deg, 24%, 40%),
                    "lighter": hsl(200deg, 24%, 42%),
                    "light": hsl(200deg, 24%, 43%),
                    "normal": hsl(200deg, 24%, 44%),
                    "bold": hsl(200deg, 24%, 46%),
                    "bolder": hsl(200deg, 25%, 47.5%),
                    "boldest": hsl(199deg, 23%, 49%),
                ),
                "light": (
                    "base": hsl(200deg, 30%, 47.5%),
                    "foreground": "light",
                    "lightest": hsl(199deg, 26%, 57%),
                    "lighter": hsl(200deg, 26%, 55%),
                    "light": hsl(200deg, 26%, 53%),
                    "normal": hsl(199deg, 27%, 51%),
                    "bold": hsl(200deg, 27%, 49%),
                    "bolder": hsl(200deg, 30%, 47.5%),
                    "boldest": hsl(200deg, 29%, 46%),
                ),
            ),
        ),
    )
);
```
