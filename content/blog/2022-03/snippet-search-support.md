# Snippet Search Support

So previously, full text search support was only available for documentation pages in the global search. Now search has been updated to have a simplistic ranking system and support for surfacing documentation snippets!

## Playground Filtering

Not only that, Playground has been updated to support filtering of all documentation snippets!

## Conclusion

Hopefully these improvements to search will boost your productivity of using the documentation site. The ranking put in place is just the initial idea of how it should work. So if you can think of anything to help, [file a new issue](https://github.com/novacbn/kahi-ui/issues/new/choose).
