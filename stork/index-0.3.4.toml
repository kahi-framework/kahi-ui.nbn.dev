F.A.Q.
Where can I get help?
If you need help with something not properly documented or needs clarification, you can visit the Issue Tracker. File a new issue and it'll be addressed on a spare time effort. Alternatively, visit the Discord Server to talk to other Kahi UI developers.
What Browsers are supported?
Visit the Browser Support documentation for more information.
Can I use the library without Svelte?
Yes, however there is no official support to do so. Visit Releases and grab the .css distributable files, and read the library source code on how to do markup, progressive enhancements, etc.
Can I use the library on Browsers that don't support or have Javascript disabled?
Yes! The library is explictly made in mind that Svelte should be used to sprinkle extra functionality ontop of logic baked in HTML / CSS. If you find something not working properly, file an issue.
Is Themeing Supported?
Not at the moment, but that'll be tackled via global CSS Custom Properties at a later time.
Is Accessibility / ARIA Supported?
While I want to implement full proper support, including keyboard navigation. It is currently not being pursued and will be tackled at a later date. However if you encounter something that'll be detrimental file an issue.

Getting Started
Installation
Using a terminal inside of your project's directory, use npm to install the package.
Importing Stylesheet
First if your toolchain supports it, import the required CSS files from @kahi-ui/framework/dist:
Otherwise download the required CSS files from Releases and use <link rel="stylesheet">:
Usage
Import Components by their variable name from @kahi-ui/framework:

Some Components are multi-part patterns, so you'll need to import their namespaces:

Responsivity
Kahi UI supports responsive design out of the box for the majority of its Components. Such as Grid, where you can define how many items are displayed at each Viewport.
Viewports
As mentioned above, Kahi UI has the concept of four pre-defined breakpoints that are known as Viewports. Which are only active whenever the Browser window's width is within two sizes.



Viewport
Minimum
Maximum




mobile
0px
640px


tablet
641px
768px


desktop
769px
1024px


widescreen
1025px
∞



Syntax
To be able to use Viewport-specific values, you just need to prefix your values with {VIEWPORT}:, e.g. <Grid points="mobile:3">. But then you can't specify default values or other Viewport-specifics. For that you need to pass an array in like below.

NOTE: The REPL currently does not support viewport values. Resize your Browser instead.
